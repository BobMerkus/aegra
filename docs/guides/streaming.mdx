Aegra streams agent execution to clients using Server-Sent Events (SSE). This gives you real-time token-by-token output, tool call updates, and state changes as they happen.

## Quick example

```python
import asyncio
from langgraph_sdk import get_client


async def main():
    client = get_client(url="http://localhost:8000")

    thread = await client.threads.create()

    async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
        thread_id=thread["thread_id"],
        assistant_id="agent",
        input={"messages": [{"type": "human", "content": "Hello!"}]},
        stream_mode=["messages-tuple"],
    ):
        if hasattr(chunk, "data") and chunk.data:
            print(chunk.data)


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Stream modes

Control what data you receive by setting `stream_mode` on the run. You can pass a single mode as a string or multiple modes as a list.

| Mode | What it streams |
|------|----------------|
| `values` | Full state snapshot after each node execution |
| `messages-tuple` | Message objects as they're generated (tokens, tool calls) |
| `events` | Low-level LangGraph events for debugging |
| `debug` | Detailed debug events with checkpoint info |

### Using multiple modes

```python
async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread_id=thread_id,
    assistant_id="agent",
    input={"messages": [{"type": "human", "content": "Search for AI news"}]},
    stream_mode=["values", "messages-tuple"],
):
    print(f"Event: {chunk.event}, Data: {chunk.data}")
```

When multiple modes are active, the `event` field tells you which mode each chunk comes from.

## Event types

During streaming, you'll receive these event types:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `metadata` | Run metadata (run_id, attempt number) — sent first |
| `values` | Full state snapshot (when using `values` mode) |
| `messages/partial` | Partial message chunk (streaming token) |
| `messages/complete` | Complete message after all tokens received |
| `messages/metadata` | Message metadata (run_id) |
| `events` | LangGraph internal events (when using `events` mode) |
| `debug` | Debug checkpoint events |
| `error` | Error during execution |
| `end` | Stream complete |

## Streaming endpoints

### Create and stream

The most common pattern — create a run and stream its output in one call:

```python
async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread_id=thread_id,
    assistant_id="agent",
    input={"messages": [{"type": "human", "content": "Hello"}]},
):
    print(chunk)
```

This calls `POST /threads/{thread_id}/runs/stream` under the hood.

### Stream an existing run

If you created a background run, you can stream it later:

```
GET /threads/{thread_id}/runs/{run_id}/stream
```

This supports reconnection via the `Last-Event-ID` header. If the connection drops, the client can reconnect and receive events from where it left off.

### Wait for completion

If you don't need streaming but want to wait for the result:

```python
result = await client.runs.wait(
    thread_id=thread_id,
    assistant_id="agent",
    input={"messages": [{"type": "human", "content": "Hello"}]},
)
print(result)
```

This calls `POST /threads/{thread_id}/runs/wait` and returns the final output.

## Subgraph streaming

If your graph uses subgraphs, you can stream events from them too:

```python
async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread_id=thread_id,
    assistant_id="agent",
    input={"messages": [{"type": "human", "content": "Hello"}]},
    stream_subgraphs=True,
):
    print(chunk)
```

## Disconnection behavior

By default, when a client disconnects during streaming, the run is cancelled. You can change this:

```python
async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread_id=thread_id,
    assistant_id="agent",
    input={"messages": [{"type": "human", "content": "Hello"}]},
    on_disconnect="continue",  # keep running even if client disconnects
):
    print(chunk)
```

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `"cancel"` (default) | Cancel the run when client disconnects |
| `"continue"` | Run continues in the background; reconnect later to get results |

## Background runs

For long-running tasks, you can create a run in the background and check on it later:

```python
# Create run (returns immediately)
run = await client.runs.create(
    thread_id=thread_id,
    assistant_id="agent",
    input={"messages": [{"type": "human", "content": "Analyze this dataset"}]},
)

# Check status
run = await client.runs.get(thread_id=thread_id, run_id=run["run_id"])
print(run["status"])  # "pending", "running", "success", "error"

# Wait for completion and get output
output = await client.runs.join(thread_id=thread_id, run_id=run["run_id"])
print(output)
```

## Cancelling runs

Cancel or interrupt a running execution:

```python
# Hard cancel
await client.runs.cancel(thread_id=thread_id, run_id=run["run_id"])

# Cooperative interrupt (if graph supports it)
await client.runs.cancel(
    thread_id=thread_id,
    run_id=run["run_id"],
    action="interrupt",
)
```

## SSE reconnection

Aegra stores streaming events in the database for replay. If your connection drops:

1. Track the last event ID you received
2. Reconnect to `GET /threads/{thread_id}/runs/{run_id}/stream` with `Last-Event-ID` header
3. You'll receive all events from where you left off

Events are retained for 1 hour after the run completes.
