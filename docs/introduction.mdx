Aegra is an open-source, self-hosted Agent Protocol server that lets you run AI agents on your own infrastructure. It's a drop-in replacement for LangGraph Platform — same SDK, same APIs, no vendor lock-in.

## What Aegra does

Aegra gives you a production-ready server for running LangGraph agents with full persistence, streaming, and authentication. You bring your own PostgreSQL database and keep complete control over your data.
