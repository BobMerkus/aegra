Aegra is an open-source, self-hosted Agent Protocol server that lets you run AI agents on your own infrastructure. It's a drop-in replacement for LangSmith Deployments — same SDK, same APIs, no vendor lock-in. Read [why teams choose Aegra](/why-aegra) over managed platforms, or jump straight to the [migration guide](/migration) if you're switching.

## Before you begin

<Tip>
  **Using an AI coding tool?** Copy the prompt below to add the Aegra **skill** and **MCP server** for better results when building with Aegra.

  ```bash
  npx skills add https://docs.aegra.dev
  ```

  Then add the Aegra MCP server for access to documentation search. Follow the setup instructions for your tool:

## What Aegra does
